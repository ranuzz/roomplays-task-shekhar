## **Goal:**

## Build a catalog search web application

## Problem:

Currently interior designers manually search for products across individual retailers. such as Wayfair, Home Depot, Amazon etc.  They would like a single tool where they can search for items across different retailers based on product name, price, in-stock availability. 

*Options for integration are listed on the spreadsheet, however, to summarize*

1. Users should be able to input product name (eg: "round coffee table"), price range and "in-stock" option - the output should include search matches from integrated retailers. 
2. Retailers to search from: eg: [Wayfair.com](http://Wayfair.com) , [Target.com](http://Target.com) or [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) (pick any 2) 
3. Show a result feed containing the list of the items - link to the product, image, product name, price. This should be infinite scrollable. 
4. Clicking on the product takes you directly to the product page. 

Below are a few optional bonus use cases- if you'd like, feel free to implement any 1

1. (Bonus) Users can signup & bookmark their favs 
2. (Bonus) Auto update feed on changes to the parent catalog 
3. (Bonus) Add any feature that you feel will enhance the user experience 

## **Tech Stack:**

Preferable to use any Javascript framework *****(although we are tech agnostic)*

Feel free to use any publicly available APIs eg: RapidAPI (these do have limitations)

## **Expectation:**

1. We are looking for a basic functional application and the focus will be on the code structure, logic and coverage of edge cases. 
2. Push the code to a public Github repository and share the link with us.
3. Host it on the internet

**[Note]** You may discover some of the publicly available APIs post challenges - you'll likely face similar challenges even in the real-world. We'd like to hear your recommendations on what limitations you find, and what work-arounds you recommend / any scope adjustments based on your understanding of the system's limitations
